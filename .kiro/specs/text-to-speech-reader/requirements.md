# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds text-to-speech (TTS) functionality to Zathura, allowing users to have PDF content read aloud. The extension will integrate with the existing Zathura architecture to provide audio narration of text content from PDF documents, with controls for playback, navigation, and voice customization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Zathura user, I want to activate text-to-speech reading for the current page, so that I can listen to the content while multitasking or when I have visual fatigue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses a designated TTS activation key THEN the system SHALL begin reading the text content of the current page aloud
2. WHEN TTS is active THEN the system SHALL highlight the currently spoken text segment
3. WHEN the user presses the TTS activation key while TTS is active THEN the system SHALL pause or resume the reading
4. IF no text is available on the current page THEN the system SHALL display a notification indicating no readable content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want to control TTS playback speed and voice settings, so that I can customize the reading experience to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses TTS settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to adjust reading speed from 0.5x to 3.0x
2. WHEN the user changes voice settings THEN the system SHALL allow selection of available system voices
3. WHEN the user adjusts volume THEN the system SHALL provide volume control from 0% to 100%
4. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL save preferences persistently across sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user reading long documents, I want to navigate through TTS reading, so that I can skip sections or jump to specific parts of the document.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TTS is active and the user presses next/previous keys THEN the system SHALL skip to the next/previous sentence or paragraph
2. WHEN TTS reaches the end of a page THEN the system SHALL automatically continue to the next page
3. WHEN the user navigates to a different page manually THEN the system SHALL stop current TTS and optionally start reading the new page
4. WHEN the user presses a stop key THEN the system SHALL immediately halt TTS playback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user working with technical documents, I want TTS to handle special content appropriately, so that mathematical formulas, tables, and figures are announced clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TTS encounters mathematical notation THEN the system SHALL attempt to read formulas in a comprehensible manner
2. WHEN TTS encounters tables THEN the system SHALL announce table structure and read content row by row
3. WHEN TTS encounters images or figures THEN the system SHALL read available alt text or captions
4. WHEN TTS encounters hyperlinks THEN the system SHALL announce the link text and optionally the destination

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer integrating TTS, I want the extension to follow Zathura's plugin architecture, so that it integrates seamlessly with existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TTS extension is loaded THEN it SHALL register as a proper Zathura plugin
2. WHEN TTS is active THEN it SHALL not interfere with existing Zathura keyboard shortcuts and navigation
3. WHEN TTS accesses document content THEN it SHALL use Zathura's existing text extraction APIs
4. WHEN the extension is disabled THEN all TTS functionality SHALL be cleanly removed without affecting core Zathura operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with different system configurations, I want TTS to work across different platforms, so that I can use the feature regardless of my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Linux THEN the system SHALL integrate with Speech Dispatcher or espeak-ng
2. WHEN running on systems without TTS engines THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
3. WHEN TTS dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL gracefully disable TTS features without breaking Zathura
4. WHEN multiple TTS engines are available THEN the system SHALL allow user selection of preferred engine
